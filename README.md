# bias-and-variance-calculate
implement a linear regression on a numerical data and see the difference between variance and bias in model 
that implement to see if how we can conclusion from calculate the varian and bias 
and try to avoid it 


we use libraries (numpy,pandas,matplotlip,scipy,sickitlearn)
